<p>Ever dreamed of owning a shop? Let's dive in! This project will teach you how to calculate your shop's net income using Python. Build a handy tool to track your earnings by inputting product sales, staff costs, and other expenses and watch Python crunch the numbers for you!

No accounting degree required!</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/343?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/343</a>
